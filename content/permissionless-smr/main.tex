\section{Permissionless and Self-Sufficient State Machine Replication with Fast Fairness}
\label{sec:permissionless-smr}

In this section, we present our permissionless state machine replication protocol \pSMR.
% 
We first present a novel parallel blockchain construction serving as a basic platform to run the ``high-level'' tasks (e.g., agreement and clock synchronization) in~\cref{subsec:new-parallel-blockchain}.
%
In~\cref{subsec:clock-sync-procedure}, in order for parties to synchronize their clocks periodically,  we propose a new time adjustment algorithm (cf.~\cref{eq:sync-shift}) based on the honest-majority Approximate Agreement protocol in~\cref{subsec:apa-honst-majority}.
%
We then, in~\cref{subsec:new-smr-protocol}, show how Byzantine agreement and state machine replication with fast fairness can be built ``on top'' of the parallel blockchains.
%
A full description of protocol \pSMR is presented in~\cref{subsec:full-protocol-description}.
