\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

We adopt Canetti's formulation of ``real world'' notion of protocol execution \cite{JC:Canetti00,EPRINT:Canetti00} to model the computation for multi-party protocols.
%
The environment \Z provides input to parties that execute the protocol $\Pi$.
%
The adversary \adv is a single entity that controls all corrupted parties; and \adv is both ``adaptive'' (i.e., take control of parties on the fly) and ``rushing'' (i.e., \adv can observe honest parties' actions and then react).
%
We describe the ``resources'' that may be available to the protocol instances (e.g., access to a ``diffuse'' channel) as \emph{ideal functionalities} in the terminology of~\cite{EPRINT:Canetti00}.
