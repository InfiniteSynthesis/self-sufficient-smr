    \caption{
        An illustration of the parallel blocktrees and the mining procedure.
        %
        Genesis blocks on each chain are represented as circles.
        %
        Teal blocks and forks depicts the view of a party at the end of the first interval.
        %
        There is no fork on the first chain; and on the second chain, forks are bookkeeped yet fail to revert the longest one.
        %
        The last two blocks in the view of a party on the third chain are discarded from the longest chain by another longer fork.
        %
        On the forth chain, all blocks in the first interval are reverted.
